# Assignment 3

The simulation of traffic flow is often used to try and model the effect of infrastructure projects
and predict overall transportation network effectiveness. As part of such a simulation system,
this project has been written in C++ to simulate traffic flow at intersections, specifically those
with four paths for traffic flow. Intersections will be simulated using queues for each incoming and outgoing traffic lane.
